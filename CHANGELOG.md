# Changelog

Newest first.

## 0.6.2 (2026-08-18)

 - The resolution dropdown got a swap button that flips any size between landscape and portrait, and custom sizes now round to the 32-pixel grid when you leave the field.
 - Every dropdown now shows its full text on hover.
 - The Tune pills are clickable and open the matching dropdown or focus the matching field.
 - The Tune section is reorganized so related settings sit together.
 - R2V now crops the first reference image to fit the frame instead of stretching it, and a hint under the references explains how multiple images are used.

## 0.6.1 (2026-08-18)

Live Preview now plays the whole clip while it samples instead of showing one still frame, powered by KJNodes Model Preview Override. A dropdown next to the Live Preview toggle picks between three presets: Fast, Balanced and Detailed. Fast is the lightest on generation speed, Detailed looks the best. Needs ComfyUI-KJNodes and taeh3.safetensors in a models/vae_approx folder.

## 0.6.0 (2026-08-18)

- The Text Encoder list now only shows the model H3 actually uses.
- New FPS setting under Duration controls frame count and output framerate.
- Right-click a video in the Library or Gallery to send it straight into Extend mode.
- Extend results are auto-staged so you can chain extends.
- Videos in the History page now have a Send to Extend button.
- Reference image and video thumbs keep their real aspect ratio instead of being cropped square.
- The Seed field clamps to the maximum the H3 model accepts.
- A Resolution chip appears on the preview.

## 0.5.2 (2026-08-18)

Each LoRA now has an on/off switch, and the Advanced panel has an Enable all / Disable all button. Disabled LoRAs keep their row but skip loading, so you can stack up to 10 LoRAs and switch between setups without deleting them.

Known issues: Chain mode can have issues, will be looked at in future releases. Images made with Image workflows can show black in the History, will be fixed in future releases.

## 0.5.1 (2026-08-17)

Fixed a bug where the node could still use an old photo right after you added a new one. The new photo now always loads before generation starts, and if loading fails the old photo stays instead of silently breaking.

## 0.5.0 (2026-08-17)

Image Edit and Reference Mix now include a Compare slider for checking the source against the result. Image mode now shows one final still instead of the internal frame batch. Upscaling in Image workflows is currently broken and will be fixed in a later release.

## 0.4.2 (2026-08-17)

Minor fixes.

## 0.4.1 (2026-08-17)

Live Preview is new: a toggle under the video that shows the clip while it samples with the tiny TAEH3 decoder. Needs the H3 Studio pack plus taeh3.safetensors in a models/vae_approx folder. Works in every video mode, but not with the Turbo preset or Image mode.

## 0.3.0 (2026-08-16)

New Image mode built on ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Studio. Text to image, edit a source image, or mix up to 9 references with @Image1 style roles. Base and LightX sampling profiles plus custom steps, sampler and scheduler. Needs the H3 Studio pack and the two Qwen3.5 prompt models, download links are in the README.

Turbo now uses whatever steps you set, 6 is only the default.

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-16)

New Native quality preset that runs the H3 pipeline with no accelerators.
